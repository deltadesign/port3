    <p>Hello, My name is Daniel Thomas. I’m a Developer from Sheffield. I started learning to code in 2020 and although I am very new to coding, I have found a passion for creating simple, user-friendly sites and applications.</p>
    <p>Coding has captured my imagination. I have tried to express this in my projects by creating a comfortable user
      experience free from clutter and noise.</p>
    <p>To date most of my work has been created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I’m almost constantly learning at this
      stage, often finding myself at the boundary of my knowledge, seeking answers and persevering to deliver a
      solution.</p>
    <p>My goal is to continue my journey as developer and grow my portfolio. If you have time please take a look at my
      work and if you’d like to get in touch, drop me an email or connect with me on Twitter /
      LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>- Dan.</p>
